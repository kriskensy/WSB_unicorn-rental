# Unicorn Rental ðŸ¦„

**Unicorn Rental** is a humorous Laravel web app for managing a magical unicorn rental business. Itâ€™s a playful project built to demonstrate modern Laravel architecture, role-based access, dynamic UI, and robust data handlingâ€”while not taking itself too seriously!

## Project Highlights

- **Humorous theme:** All about renting magical unicorns for parties, events, and fun!
- **Modern Laravel 12 stack:** MVC, Eloquent ORM, Blade, Tailwind CSS.
- **Role-based controls:** Admins manage unicorns; users book, review, and rate.
- **Animated homepage slogan:** Big, pastel, and glowing for that unicorn magic.
- **Ratings everywhere:** Average unicorn ratings and user reviews shown as stars.
- **Policies & middleware:** Secure, granular access to all actions.

---

## What Was Challenging?

- Managing route conflicts (e.g., `reviews/create` vs `reviews/{review}`).
- Implementing fine-grained authorization and policies in Laravel 12.
- Achieving a truly magical, responsive UI with custom CSS and Tailwind.

---

## What Would I Do Differently?

- Modularize components even earlier.
- Plan routes and policies more carefully.
- Focus more on accessibility and notifications.
